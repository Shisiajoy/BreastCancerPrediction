# Breast Cancer Prediction App ðŸŽ—ðŸŽ—

This application predicts the likelihood of breast cancer in mammogram images using a TensorFlow Lite quantized model. It provides a simple interface for users to upload an image, process it, and receive a prediction. The goal is to explore the use of AI in healthcare, specifically for early detection of breast cancer


Key Features

Image Upload: Accepts mammogram images in PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats.
Preprocessing: Automatically resizes images, converts them to grayscale, and normalizes them for the model.

Prediction: Utilizes a quantized TensorFlow Lite model to classify the images as "Cancer" or "No Cancer" based on a set threshold.

User Feedback: Provides clear results and relevant guidance based on the prediction.
